1) Only characters encoded in valid US-ASCII will be inputted into the functions contained within the backend 
   of UNSW Memes. That is characters that are encoded through Unicode (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32), and other 
   similar encoding types will not inputted into any of the functions. Therefore accounting for these types 
   of characters in the functions is irrelevant, and errors caused by these characters being inputted can be
   ignored.
