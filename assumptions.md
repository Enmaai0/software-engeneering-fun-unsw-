1) All valid unicode values are allowed to be entered into any input that is of form 'string'. That is passwords, names, etc can contain characters encoded in the unicode format such as emojis, foreing characters, etc.

2) We aren't limited in the implementation of our project by barriers such as time complexity (big O notation) 
   and memory storage. That is we have no restraints in regards to how long it takes for our functions and execute
   and how much storage our dataStore needs. 

3) The email address of a user is used for authentication and security purposes, meaning that all emails are
   unique and are associated with unique data.

4) We are able to utelise any type of npm package in the implementation of our project.

5) The unique identifier number (id) for a user or channel should lie between 0 and 9999999.

6) The auhUserId is the same as the id contained within a users object in the dataStore. That is a user who enters
   123 into a function, will relate that authUserId to user with id 123.
